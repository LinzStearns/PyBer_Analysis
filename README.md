# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### This analysis explores extensive ride-sharing data from PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, to evaluate the relationships that exist between the type of city, number of drivers & riders and fares within those types of cities. Ultimately, the findings of this analysis serve to help drive the decision making for company executives in addressing disparities of affordability to customers among differing city types. 

## Findings

At a high level, in 2019 there is clearly a negative trend between the average fare of rides and the total number of rides in each city.

The data as pictured in the above chart shows that in the year 2019, people in Rural citites took less rides than in people Urban cities. At a quick glance, one can also discern that fares in Rural cities trend higher than in Suburban and Rural cities.

This box plot further supports our above hypothesis, showcasing more clearly that there is a disparity between the number of rides taken according to city type.

Although the disparity in *fares* by city type is slightly muted compared to the *number* of rides, the data shows that on average, fares are higher in rural cities. 


To analyze these findings on a more granular level, we shortened the time frame of analysis to approximately the first 4 months of the year.

The above graphic effectively juxtaposes all three city types, allowing us to see the relationship between total fares by city type. The data shown here reaffirms the afforementioned findings. There is clearly a disparity in the amount of fares generated according to city type. 

## Summary

Based on the analysis, the following three actions items are recoomended for Executive Leadership:

1. Rural cities are shown to have higher fares yet low cumulative fares. The high cost of individual rides could be a deterrant for customers. By lowering the fees and fares in Rural cities, we could expand on our total addressable market and encourage more rides. Maintaining a higher fare while increasing the number of rides would be lucrative for PyBer while also reducing the disparities in affordability. 

2. Urban cities are shown to have lower fares per ride compared to both rural and suburban cities. Increasing the fares in Urban cities would increase revenue for PyBer, enabling the possibility for a shift in resources that would allow for fares to be lowered in rural and suburban cities. This would increase accesibility in both rural and suburban cities. 

3. Rural cities have a significantly lower number of drivers compared to Urban and Suburban cities. This could be an underlying contributing factor towards poor customer accessibility and thus a lower number of total rides in rural cities as well as lower cumulative fares in rural cities. Increasing the number of drivers in rural cities could help increase the number of rides in the area.
